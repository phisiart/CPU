ERROR:Pack:2412 - The number of logical LUT blocks exceeds the capacity for the target device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                17,529 out of  18,224   96%
    Number used as Flip Flops:              17,408
    Number used as Latches:                     92
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:               29
  Number of Slice LUTs:                     27,238 out of   9,112  298% (OVERMAPPED)
    Number used as logic:                   27,235 out of   9,112  298% (OVERMAPPED)
      Number using O6 output only:          26,648
      Number using O5 output only:              88
      Number using O5 and O6:                  499
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      3
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         3
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       212 out of   4,556    4%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       27,348
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:        10,206 out of  27,348   37%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 110 out of  27,348    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:      17,032 out of  27,348   62%
    Number of unique control sets:              51
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             268 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        35 out of     232   15%
